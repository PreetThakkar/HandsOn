## Programming in Python[^2]
* ### Game of Hangman

## Weather Plotting

  One thousand weather stations were sent out all over the world at the beginning of 2016, ready to be assembled and begin collecting global weather data. The idea here is to get data from these stations and plot any particular dimension on a geo plot. You can check the end plot [here](WeatherPlotting/README.md#end-result)

Wherever possible, the source to a problem set will be mentioned.

## Wiki Anonymous Edit Tracker

  The application traces anonymous edits make on any given Wikipedia page by extracting edit IP addresses and transforming it to geographical coordinates. These coordinates are then utilized to plot the edits on the world map providing a visual representation of their locations. Tou can checn the end plot [here](Wiki%20Edit%20Tracker/plot.png)
